# Islamic-Lunar-Celander
This HTML5 project is a Lunar Islamic Calendar application inspired by the teachings of Sheikh Imran Hosein, particularly from his recent lectures on "The Qur'an and the System of Sacred Time" delivered in Jember on June 26-27, 2025. The application visualizes the Islamic lunar calendar system, emphasizing the importance of moon-based timekeeping in Islamic tradition.
Inspiration from Sheikh Imran Hosein's Teachings

This project embodies several key concepts from Sheikh Imran Hosein's lectures on Sacred Time:

Lunar-Based Timekeeping:
Implements the Qur'anic system of time measurement based on moon cycles
Visualizes the connection between lunar phases and Islamic months
Sacred Time Concept:

Emphasizes the natural, God-created system of time
Contrast with Gregorian Calendar:
Shows both systems side-by-side to demonstrate differences
Illustrates the artificial nature of solar-based calendars
